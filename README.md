## !!! News !!!

Names in the Animation Groups panel are now shown in the order in which the transition groups appear as children of the `::view-transition` pseudo-element. This makes it easier to understand how the individual groups overlap during rendering.

For details, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vtbag/inspection-chamber/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## What happened so far:


> You can now observe in real-time how CSS properties are updated by animations and easily see which other properties are applied to the pseudo-elements created by the View Transition API.

> Added ability to switch single animations on and off as you navigate through the timeline of view transitions. For example, you can temporarily disable fades while investigating a morph animation or disable morphing to focus on other features of your transition.

* Improved error reporting for missing animations or corrupted keyframe definitions.
* Improved opening the Chamber on mobiles.
* Explicit close button to the inner panel and fixes some styling issues.
* Better integration into same-document and cross-document transitions.
* Further optimizations for identifying transition elements on the screen.

## What is it?
