## !!! News !!!

Now compatible with the View Transition API Level 2 signature for `startViewTransition({types:..., update:...})`!

For latest changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vtbag/inspection-chamber/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## What happened so far:

> In addition to CSS animations of pseudo-elements, the Chamber can now also handle animations of pseudo-elements started using the Web Animation API.

> Improved error handling

> Names in the Animation Groups panel are now shown in the order in which the transition groups appear as children of the `::view-transition` pseudo-element. This makes it easier to understand how the individual groups overlap during the transition.

* Observe in real-time how CSS properties are updated by animations
* Ability to switch single animations on and off
* Improved error reporting for missing animations or corrupted keyframe definitions.
* Improved opening the Chamber on mobiles.
* Explicit close button to the inner panel and fixes some styling issues.
* Better integration into same-document and cross-document transitions.
* Further optimizations for identifying transition elements on the screen.
