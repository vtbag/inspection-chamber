## !!! News !!!

The items of the name panel escaped their scrollable list during view transitions. Fixed that. Read more about the root cause at https://vtbag.dev/basics/hide-and-seek/.

Better support for short pages.

For latest changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vtbag/inspection-chamber/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## What happened so far:

> Now compatible with the View Transition API Level 2 signature for `startViewTransition({types:..., update:...})`!

> In addition to CSS animations of pseudo-elements, the Chamber can now also handle animations of pseudo-elements started using the Web Animation API.

> Names in the Animation Groups panel are now shown in the order in which the transition groups appear as children of the `::view-transition` pseudo-element. This makes it easier to understand how the individual groups overlap during the transition.

Also:
* Observe in real-time how CSS properties are updated by animations
* Ability to switch single animations on and off
