These are notes on the new development of the next generation of the Chamber.

attach.ts:  
- when run in an iframe: set up the hooks into the View Transition API
- when run in the top-level window, replace the DOM with InspectionChamber.astro, where the original page is embedded using an iframe. See bin/bundle script for the htmlSting() function

attach.astro
- a test page for attach.ts with some buttons to start view transitions

  others like this: test/AnimationsTest.astro

InspectionChamber.astro
- The controls with an embedded iframe. The src of the iframe and its title will be overridden if pulled by attach.ts. 
- The page can be viewed stand alone, too. Then the embedded iframe defaults to attach.astro (via symbolic link in src/pages)

Animations: The main driver. Provides hooks to be called from iframe. Idea: instead of expecting everything in top, use self.parent instead (would allow to inspect the inspection chamber with the inspection chamber) 


todo: not all browsers might have group-children for nested transitions
