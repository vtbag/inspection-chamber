# @vtbag

The Inspection Chamber is the inaugural tool under the @vtbag umbrella. If the name reminds you of vtbot, that's no coincidence.

When Chrome introduced the (same-document) View Transition API, Astro quickly became an early adopter, offering a client-side router to transform MPAs into smooth SPAs. As a community-driven project, [astro-vtbot](https://events-3bg.pages.dev), the *Bag of Tricks for Astro's View Transitions*, delivered numerous technical demos, reusable components, and a wealth of information about View Transitions within Astro and the View Transition API at large.

With the View Transition API now being adopted by more browsers and even supporting cross-document navigation, vtbot has evolved. Meet its framework-independent sibling: `@vtbag`

`@vtbag/*` is set to provide a treasure trove of useful tools, tips (and of course tricks!) to enhance your experience with View Transitions, no matter which framework you're using, or even if you're using none at all.
